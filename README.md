## About The Project

This is a capstone project for my Software Engineer Apprenticeship at Year Up. This project entails an E-Commerce Store for modern kitchen gadgets. The company I created is called "Kitchen Simply". I also designed the brand's logo. My website features six pages (Home, Register, Login, Products, Checkout, and Payment).

## Project Goals

- Create an intuitive flow for user experience.
- Simple, modern aesthetic.
- Provide an online store with checkout features.

### Interesting Piece of HTML/CSS

1. Hover Effect Over Gallery Images
2. In Pages > `product.html`:


  ```html
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 ProdCategory">
</div>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3 GalleryBox">
<a href="item.html" title="see details"><img src="images2/veg.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Demo picture"> </a>
  ```
  3. In Pages > `styles.css`:

  ```css

 .GalleryBox img {
     /* width: 330px;
     height: 305px; */
     margin-top: 20px;
     transition: 0.5s;
     padding: 10px;
     border-width:2px;
     border-style: solid;
     border-color: white;
     box-shadow: 0px 0px 15px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.55);  
 }
 
 .GalleryBox img:hover {
     filter: brightness(100%) saturate(120%) contrast(120%) ;
     border-color:purple;
      transition: 0.5s;
     transform: scale(1.01);
     
 }
  ```
