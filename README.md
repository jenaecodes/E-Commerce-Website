## About The Project

This is a capstone project for my Software Engineer Apprenticeship at Year Up. This project entails an E-Commerce Store for modern kitchen gadgets. The company I created is called "Kitchen Simply". I also designed the brand's logo. My website features six pages (Home, Register, Login, Products, Checkout, and Payment).
